# Collect-the-flowers-
This is a simple game built from scratch using pygame module. 
In this game, you have to collect 50 falling flowers, avoiding the falling cactus plants. 
Each level is of 15 flowers, so once you collect them, you level up!
Collecting 50 flowers makes you win!
If you collect a cactus, it will make you lose a life. You have 3 lives in total, so play safe!

NOTE:
The code reference has been taken from elsewhere, but the game is built by myself. It might bear resemblance with multiple games. I do not intend to plagiarise anyone's work. I am trying these out as an exercise for fun!
Thanks!
